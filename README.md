# Genetic matching using R

Here you can find all resources for the IAU workshop on running genetic matching in R. This workshop aims to teach the basic principles of how to run genetic matching using observational data, where we would like to examine the change made by an intervention to a healthcare outcome. In this workshop we also run some introductory data checks and produce descriptive statistics to understand the structure of a fake healthcare dataset provided.

## Data source

This project does not use any real data. We built a small fake dataset intended to replicate a patient level data where some patients received an intervention aimed at reducing a negative outcome.
